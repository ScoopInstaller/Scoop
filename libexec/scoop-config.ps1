#       * An empty or unset value for proxy is equivalent to 'default' (with no username or password)
#       * To bypass the system proxy and connect directly, use 'none' (with no username or password)
#
# autostash_on_conflict: $true|$false
#       When a conflict is detected during updating, Scoop will auto-stash the uncommitted changes.
#       (Default is $false, which will abort the update)

#
# cat_style:
#       When set to a non-empty string, Scoop will use 'bat' to display the manifest for
#       the `scoop cat` command and while doing manifest review. This requires 'bat' to be
#       installed (run `scoop install bat` to install it), otherwise errors will be thrown.

#
# ignore_running_processes: $true|$false
#       When set to $false (default), Scoop would stop its procedure immediately if it detects

#       When set to $true, Scoop only displays a warning message and continues procedure.
#
# private_hosts:
#       Array of private hosts that need additional authentication.
