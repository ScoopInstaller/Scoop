# Usage: scoop bucket add|list|known|rm [<args>]
# Summary: Manage Scoop buckets
# Help: Add, list or remove buckets.
#
# Buckets are repositories of apps available to install. Scoop comes with
# a default bucket, but you can also add buckets that you or others have
# published.
#
# To add a bucket:
#     scoop bucket add <name> [<repo>]
#
# e.g.:
#     scoop bucket add extras https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras.git
#
# Since the 'extras' bucket is known to Scoop, this can be shortened to:
#     scoop bucket add extras
#
# To list all known buckets, use:
#     scoop bucket known
