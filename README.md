Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows.

## What does Scoop do?

Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It tries to eliminate things like:

- Permission popup windows
- GUI wizard-style installers
- Path pollution from installing lots of programs
- Unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
- The need to find and install dependencies
- The need to perform extra setup steps to get a working program

Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:

```powershell
scoop install sudo
sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global
scoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch
scoop install python ruby go perl
```

If you've built software that you'd like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer (e.g. MSI or InnoSetup) — you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.

## Requirements

- Windows 7 SP1+ / Windows Server 2008+
- [PowerShell 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5download) (or later, include [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6)) and [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) (or later)
- PowerShell must be enabled for your user account e.g. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

## Installation

Run this command from your PowerShell to install scoop to its default location (`C:\Users\<user>\scoop`)

```powershell
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

Once installed, run `scoop help` for instructions.

The default setup is configured so all user installed programs and Scoop itself live in `C:\Users\<user>\scoop`.
Globally installed programs (`--global`) live in `C:\ProgramData\scoop`.
These settings can be changed through environment variables.

### Install Scoop to a Custom Directory

```powershell
$env:SCOOP='D:\Applications\Scoop'
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP', $env:SCOOP, 'User')
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

### Configure Scoop to install global programs to a Custom Directory

```powershell
$env:SCOOP_GLOBAL='F:\GlobalScoopApps'
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP_GLOBAL', $env:SCOOP_GLOBAL, 'Machine')
```

## [Documentation](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki)

## Multi-connection downloads with `aria2`

Scoop can utilize [`aria2`](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to use multi-connection downloads. Simply install `aria2` through Scoop and it will be used for all downloads afterward.

```powershell
scoop install aria2
```

You can tweak the following `aria2` settings with the `scoop config` command:

- aria2-enabled (default: true)
- [aria2-retry-wait](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-retry-wait) (default: 2)
- [aria2-split](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-s) (default: 5)
- [aria2-max-connection-per-server](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-x) (default: 5)
- [aria2-min-split-size](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-k) (default: 5M)

## What sort of apps can Scoop install?

The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory.

Since installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers).

Scoop is also great at handling single-file programs and Powershell scripts. These don't even need to be compressed. See the [runat](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/runat.json) package for an example: it's really just a GitHub gist.

## Known application buckets

The following buckets are known to scoop:

- [main](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main) - Default bucket for the most common (mostly CLI) apps
- [extras](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras) - Apps that don't fit the main bucket's [criteria](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/Criteria-for-including-apps-in-the-main-bucket)
- [games](https://github.com/Calinou/scoop-games) - Open source/freeware games and game-related tools
- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/matthewjberger/scoop-nerd-fonts) -  Nerd Fonts
- [nirsoft](https://github.com/kodybrown/scoop-nirsoft) - A subset of the [250](https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory/blob/master/by-score.md#MCOfficer_scoop-nirsoft) [Nirsoft](https://nirsoft.net) apps
- [java](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Java) - Installers for Oracle Java, OpenJDK, Zulu, ojdkbuild, AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon Corretto, BellSoft Liberica & SapMachine
- [jetbrains](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-JetBrains) - Installers for all JetBrains utilities and IDEs
<!-- * [nightlies](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Nightlies) - No longer used -->
- [nonportable](https://github.com/oltolm/scoop-nonportable) - Non-portable apps (may require UAC)
- [php](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/PHP) - Installers for most versions of PHP
- [versions](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Versions) - Alternative versions of apps found in other buckets

The main bucket is installed by default. To add any of the other buckets, type:
```
> scoop bucket add bucketname
```
For example, to add the extras bucket, type:
```
> scoop bucket add extras
```

## Other application buckets

Many other application buckets hosted on Github can be found in the [Scoop Directory](https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory).
