Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows.

## What does Scoop do?

Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It tries to eliminate things like:
* Permission popup windows
* GUI wizard-style installers
* Path pollution from installing lots of programs
* Unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
* The need to find and install dependencies
* The need to perform extra setup steps to get a working program

Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:

```powershell
scoop install sudo
sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global
scoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch
scoop install python ruby go perl
```

If you've built software that you'd like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer (e.g. MSI or InnoSetup) â€” you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.

## Requirements

* Windows 7 SP1+ / Windows Server 2008+
* [PowerShell 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595) (or later) and [.NET Framework 4.5+](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* PowerShell must be enabled for your user account e.g. `set-executionpolicy remotesigned -s currentuser`

## Installation

Run this command from your PowerShell to install scoop to its default location (`C:\Users\<user>\scoop`)
```powershell
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

Once installed, run `scoop help` for instructions.

The default setup is configured so all user installed programs and Scoop itself live in `C:\Users\<user>\scoop`.
Globally installed programs (`--global`) live in `C:\ProgramData\scoop`.
These settings can be changed through environment variables.

#### Install Scoop to a Custom Directory
```powershell
[environment]::setEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP','D:\Applications\Scoop','User')
$env:SCOOP='D:\Applications\Scoop'
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

#### Configure Scoop to install global programs to a Custom Directory
```powershell
[environment]::setEnvironmentVariable('SCOOP_GLOBAL','F:\GlobalScoopApps','Machine')
$env:SCOOP_GLOBAL='F:\GlobalScoopApps'
```

## Multi-connection downloads with `aria2`
Scoop can utilize [`aria2`](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to use multi-connection downloads. Simply install `aria2` through Scoop and it will be used for all downloads afterward.
```powershell
scoop install aria2
```

You can tweak the following `aria2` settings with the `scoop config` command:

- aria2-enabled (default: true)
- [aria2-retry-wait](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-retry-wait) (default: 2)
- [aria2-split](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-s) (default: 5)
- [aria2-max-connection-per-server](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-x) (default: 5)
- [aria2-min-split-size](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption-k) (default: 5M)

## What sort of apps can Scoop install?

The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory.

Since installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers).

Scoop is also great at handling single-file programs and Powershell scripts. These don't even need to be compressed. See the [runat](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/blob/master/bucket/runat.json) package for an example: it's really just a GitHub gist.
